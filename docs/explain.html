<div id = 'explainStuff'>TL;DR: To calculate your chances of receiving a reward from a category, I use 1 - (1 - your odds of receiving a reward in that category) ^ boxes simulated, and factor in the changing in-game luck factor when dealing with legendaries.<br><br>To calculate your chances of receiving brawlers, I use the wonders of statistics. Obviously, there is no number of brawl boxes that you can open to be guaranteed a brawler. Your chance will approach 100%, but never reach it. So I find the benchmark odds of 25%, 50%, and 75%. And ironically, to find the odds of receiving a brawler, I have to calculate the odds of <b>not</b> receiving a brawler. To start, I convert all chances into their decimal counterparts (so 100% would equal 1). Then, I basically simulate opening a box a bunch of times. I start with a chance of 1 to not receive a reward, and then for every brawl box simulated multiply that chance by 1 minus the chance of receiving a reward from that category, or in other words, your chance of not receiving a reward of that category. After doing this <em>x</em> times, I can subtract the value I have from one to find your odds of receiving that brawler from <em>x</em> boxes. For legendary brawlers, I have to factor in the luck value. As I have no set data on how the luck factor changes (<b>please, Supercell</b>), I'm forced to take a ballpark estimate and assume that it changes your chance of receiving a legendary brawler by 0.01% every 200 boxes, or 0.00005% per box. To account for this, I merely increase your chance of receiving a legendary brawler by the change in the luck factor for a single box after every time I simulate opening a box.<br><br>But there's more! According to the details Supercell gives, having all rewards of a category increases your chances of receiving rewards from all other categories. Again, I'm forced to take a shot in the dark here and assume how this 'extra percentage' is distributed, but I think I calculate it correctly. Say you only need two legendary brawlers and some power points. If your legendary chance were a generic 0.1%, these percentages would only add up to 94.3%, leaving an extra 5.7% that must be divvied up between these two categories. I do this based on the percentage of the total percent that each category takes up. For example, your odds of a legendary brawler would take up 0.1/94.3 = 0.00106 / 1 of the sum of these 'valid percentages'. Therefore, I would add (5.7 * 0.00106)% to your legendary chance, meaning the actual chance would be around 0.10604%. It's a small boost, but it's definitely not negligible. I then perform the same calculations for all other valid reward categories.<br><br>Have questions or spelling errors to bring to my attention?
